# Vitter

Vitter is an application inspired by Twitter. I tried to make twitter be like i wanted to using Typescript, Nextjs and Tailwind. I havent implemented all the layout yet but you can see the entire design project on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/qk1Mm8M8T9x93QdiIx9mFU/Vitter?node-id=0%3A1&t=rIgwXTsOFsIyeMyt-1)
